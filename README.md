# DecoderRing
 A program to run various types of cypher

A project to practice javascript by writing three different decoding and encoding methods.

This project can be used to send coded messeges to a partner and decode their response.

This project offers three types of code, a ceasar shift, a polybius shift, and a substitution cypher.
A user can choose one, choose a key that matches the code they chose, and write any message. The application
will encode their message which can be shared with anyone, and only those who know the chosen key can use
the same application to decode it again.

This application is made with Javascript, CSS, and HTML. It exists to help me practice methods is javascript.
